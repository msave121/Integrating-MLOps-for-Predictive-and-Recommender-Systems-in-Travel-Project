    "This capstone project demonstrates the end-to-end application of data analytics, machine learning, and MLOps within the travel and tourism domain. By leveraging three core datasets — users, flights, and hotels — the project aims to extract meaningful insights, build predictive and recommendation models, and deploy them using modern, production-grade tools and workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project begins with a strong foundation in data understanding and exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns in user behavior, travel routes, pricing trends, and accommodation preferences. These insights guide feature selection and model design decisions across multiple machine learning use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary focus of the project is the development of a regression model to predict flight prices based on factors such as distance, duration, flight type, and agency. This model is exposed through a REST API built using Flask, enabling real-time predictions. To ensure portability and scalability, the application is containerized using Docker and deployed on Kubernetes, allowing it to efficiently handle varying workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond model development, the project emphasizes real-world MLOps practices. Automated workflows are implemented using Apache Airflow to orchestrate data processing and model-related tasks. A CI/CD pipeline built with Jenkins ensures seamless integration, testing, and deployment of model updates. MLflow is used to track experiments, manage model versions, and maintain reproducibility throughout the model lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to price prediction, the project includes a gender classification model to categorize users and a travel recommendation system that suggests hotels based on user preferences and historical behavior. These recommendations and insights are presented through an interactive Streamlit web application, providing a user-friendly interface for exploration and decision support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project delivers a comprehensive, production-ready machine learning pipeline that combines predictive modeling, recommendation systems, scalable deployment, and automated operations. It showcases the practical application of machine learning and MLOps concepts to solve real-world challenges in the travel and tourism industry."
